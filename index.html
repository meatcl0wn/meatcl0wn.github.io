		<p>The Great Beyond is a game in development by Horse Games Digital. It may release in late 2023, or later than that, or never.</p>
			<p>You play as Mo, a dead soul who has been trapped in the step just before the Great Beyond. Some might call it purgatory, but it is merely a stepping stone on the tracks to the Great Beyond. You, like everybody else around you, feel the pull to travel on to the next step, but you can't, nobody can, not until the train tracks are unblocked. The souls keep piling up. Madness runs rife among your fellow dead, and it is up to you, Mo, to unblock the tunnels.Why it's not the task of one of the many <a href="gallery.html"><strong>Demi-Gods</strong></a> who live among you is not for you to know (they're lazy).</p>
			<p>In order to unblock the tunnels, and save your humanity and everyone else's, you must travel through many locations of "purgatory," fulfilling quests, making friends (or enemies), and collecting hats!
